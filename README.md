# Critical-Price-Levels-Identifier
Used FinDiff, NumPy and pandas library to identify key levels in price data using calculus.

- Wrote an algorithm which identifies key points in price data if they can be categorized as a minimum or maximum value.
> get_extrema(isMin) function
- Created lowerbounds and upperbounds to group extrema falling within the same desired range
> Allows the algorithm to count the amount of times price touches particular extrema points, providing a useful measurement for price sensitivity at the corresponding points
